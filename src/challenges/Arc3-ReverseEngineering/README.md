# Rush the Warehouses (RE)

This series of challenges is part of the `Rush the Warehouses` ARG story arc. In this arc players will remotely reverse engineer digital locks protecting a data warehouse Hax4Headz members are infiltraing. 

In these tasks, on site Hax4Headz hackers will be extracting and sending you the machine code of the locks and asking you to reverse engineer the correct key to bypass the locks.
